`KoboToolbox` allows the collection of spatial data through three questions types: **geopoint**, **geotrace** and **geoshape**.

**Geopoint:**<br>
The geopoint question type captures a single geographic coordinate (latitude and longitude) including altitude and accuracy. This is useful for marking locations, such as homes, schools, or water sources.

**Geotrace:**<br>
The geotrace question type collects a series of connected geographic coordinates, forming a line. This can be used to map routes, paths, or boundaries.

**Geoshape:**<br>
A geoshape question type captures a series of geographic coordinates that form a closed polygon. This is useful for defining areas, such as land parcels, agricultural fields, or protected zones.

To utilize these data types, we need to parse them into a GIS friendly format. `robotoolbox` uses [Well-Known Text (WKT)](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkt/), a standard markup language for representing vector geometry, to represent points (`geopoint`), lines (`geotrace`) and polygons (`geoshape`).


## Spatial data

The following form provides a simple demonstration of how `robotoolbox` maps spatial field types.

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
library(robotoolbox)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(mapview)
mapview::mapviewOptions(
    fgb = FALSE,
    basemaps = c(
      "Esri.WorldImagery",
      "Esri.WorldShadedRelief",
      "OpenTopoMap",
      "OpenStreetMap"),
    layers.control.pos = "topright")
```


```{r asset_list, echo = FALSE}
l <- asset_list
```

### Survey questions

|name                |type     |label                          |
|:-------------------|:--------|:------------------------------|
|point               |geopoint |Record a location              |
|point_description   |text     |Describe the recorded location |
|line                |geotrace |Record a line                  |
|line_description    |text     |Describe the recorded line     |
|polygon             |geoshape |Record a polygon               |
|polygon_description |text     |Describe the recorded polygon  |

The form includes three spatial type columns: `point`, `line` and `polygon`.

### Loading the project

The aforementioned form, named `Spatial data`, was uploaded to the server. You can load it from the `asset_list` of assets.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(robotoolbox)
library(dplyr)
asset_list <- kobo_asset_list()
uid <- filter(asset_list, name == "Spatial data") |>
  pull(uid)
asset <- kobo_asset(uid)
asset
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
asset <- asset_spatial
asset
```

We have a single submission, where we recorded one location using a `geopoint` question, mapped a portion of a road using a `geotrace` question, and outlined a stadium using a `geoshape`` question.

### Extracting the data

From the assets, we can proceed to extract the submissions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- kobo_data(asset)
glimpse(df)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- data_spatial
glimpse(df)
```

We can see that we have all of our three columns `point`, `line` and `polygon`. For each of them, we have a corresponding WKT column.

```{r}
pull(df, point)
pull(df, point_wkt)
```

For `geopoint` types, `robotoolbox` also offers columns for latitude, longitude, altitude, and precision.

```{r}
df |>
  select(starts_with("point_"))
```

The `line` column, derived from the `geotrace` question, has a corresponding `line_wkt` column.

```{r}
pull(df, line)
pull(df, line_wkt)
```

Lastly, `polygon_wkt` is the WKT column derived from the `geoshape` question labeled `polygon`.

```{r}
pull(df, polygon)
pull(df, polygon_wkt)
```

Now that we understand how `robotoolbox` stores spatial question types, we can convert these columns into spatial objects suitable for spatial data analysis.

## Geopoint

The standard approach to manipulate spatial vector data in `R` involves using the `sf` package. `sf` stands for Simple Features and it extends a `data.frame` by adding a geometry list-column. It's a spatially enabled `data.frame`.
It provides an interface to the popular [GDAL](https://gdal.org/), [GEOS](https://libgeos.org/), [PRÃ˜J](https://proj.org/) and [S2](https://s2geometry.io/) libraries. It can be used to efficiently manipulate and visualize spatial vector data.

Creating an `sf` object from a text column that contains  [`WKT`](https://libgeos.org/specifications/wkt/) characters is straightforward. The `sf::st_as_sf` function can be used to turn the `data.frame` with a `WKT` column into an `sf` object.

```{r}
point_sf <- st_as_sf(data_spatial,
                     wkt = "point_wkt", crs = 4326)
mapview(point_sf)
```

## Geotrace

We can also transform a `data.frame` with a column from a `geotrace` question to an `sf` object with a `LINESTRING` geometry. The `WKT` column is named `line_wkt`.

```{r}
line_sf <- st_as_sf(data_spatial,
                     wkt = "line_wkt", crs = 4326)
mapview(line_sf)
```


## Geoshape

The column `polygon_wkt` can be used to create an `sf` polygon object. It's a simple closed polygon.

```{r}
poly_sf <- st_as_sf(data_spatial,
                    wkt = "polygon_wkt", crs = 4326)
mapview(poly_sf)
```

Not only does `robotoolbox` rely on the `sf` package, but it also leverages other packages from the same ecosystem to provide robust spatial data analysis for `KoboToolbox` users.

You can learn a lot about the `sf` packages and spatial data analysis with R from the excellent [Geocomputation with R](https://r.geocompx.org/) book and through the extensive `sf` [package documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/).
